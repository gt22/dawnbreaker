There they spoke with the Twins in dreams, and they learnt how they might become conjoined as one flesh, and immortal.\n\n\nNow the brother's resolution failed her, and though he loved his sister, he could not choose to spend eternity joined in one flesh. The sister could not persuade him, and she would not abandon him or force him. So they used their arts to live long lives, close but separate, and they made a double foundation of monks and nuns, as chaste as they had always been, but each nun had her brother-twin and none could enter alone.\n\nIn time, the sister found her own immortality, and to this day she walks the world by moonlight. The brother died, and his bones are buried in the room beneath the well. But his children live on.</i>",

At his death, the monks sought to stone her for her impurities. She bore Columba's bones away so the monks would not have them - substituting, out of tact or mischief, the bones of a horse. She brought the bones to a hidden Isle, where she made a double foundation of nuns and monks, and become its first abbess: but she would admit none to her order who was a virgin, nor innocent of any crime. Since then, the Isle has been a refuge for all the world might consider impure.</i>\r",
